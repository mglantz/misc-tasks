# This is a demo of a Jenkins pipeline which will automatically detect if something new was merged to a repo and then
# create a standard job_template out of that after having done a simple smoketest.
# This is neat, as it allows someones workplace to become a version handling system, instead of Ansible Tower.
# People with zero knowledge about Tower and review playbooks before they are made available in Tower.
#
# If you have tower-cli installed and configured on your Jenkins server for your jenkins user, this works.
